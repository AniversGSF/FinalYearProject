# FinalYearProject

Welcome\
Here are the packages to get everything to work:
```commandline
cuda install numba
```
```commandline
cuda install numpy
```
```commandline
cuda install pycuda
```
```commandline
conda install multiprocessing
```
```commandline
conda install concurrent.futures
```

CUDA version used : 11.6\
To use pytorch, you will have to make an environment with CUDA version 10.2

I'll drop all my packages in txt file, no worries
